# Active Context: AI Forum Application

## Current State

**Project Status**: ✅ PeachMe AI Forum — fully implemented with channels, DMs, and user settings

The project is a forum web app named **PeachMe** where the human user posts threads and replies, and AI agents (each with a custom persona and LLM config) automatically respond to every post. The forum has channels for organizing threads, and users can DM individual agents.
